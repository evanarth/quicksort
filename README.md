# quicksort
quicksort algorithms for floating points and integers

this is a basic implimentation, and something every coder needs in his/her programming cookbook
average complexity is O(N log(N)), and the worst-case complexity is O(N^2).

since this algorithm is light-weight in its memory allocation, it is often the fastest sort
